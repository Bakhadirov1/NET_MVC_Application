# MVC Application
This is a university project given as a final assignment for Database Systems Development module.
The assignment had following requirements and criterias:
- CRUD operations
- Import/Export in CSV, XML, JSON
- SQL Modifications log triggers
- SQL business rules triggers
- Usage of SQL Stored Procedures


# Technologies used
- .NET 5 MVC Project
- MSSQL LocalDB
- Dapper
- X.PagedList

### The project is far away from being ideal. It violates most of the OOP and SOLID principles because main aim was on required functionality

**P.S. It was a group assignment for 4 students, but it happened that I had to do it all myself**
